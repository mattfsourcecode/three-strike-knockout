## Achieve the best experience 😀

I am suggesting using Chrome to run this app. Other browsers are having difficulty rendering the SVG sprites.

First try playing a few times using the default configuration (i.e. just click the “Start” button without changing anything). Get a feel for the game, and then start choosing some different parameters.

*NOTE: This application was developed using a 13-in MacBook Pro. Responsiveness attributes were programmed such that the application is assumed to be cross-device compatible, however, it has not been tested on any other screen sizes or operating systems so there may be some responsiveness bugs on non-13-in-Macbook-Pro devices.*

## There are three main views within the app that will ideally look like this:

### Card deck configuration modal

See any bugs? 🪲 [Open an issue](https://github.com/matt-eric/three-strike-knockout/issues) or email me @ [mf9646a@alumni.american.edu](mailto:mf9646a@alumni.american.edu).

*HINT: To make the game slightly more challenging, adjust the* `chipCoordinateY` *value from* `300` *to* `350`.
