#### [`/public/index.html`](https://github.com/matt-eric/three-strike-knockout/blob/master/public/index.html)
#### [`/src/styles.css`](https://github.com/matt-eric/three-strike-knockout/blob/master/src/styles.css)
#### [`tailwind.config.js`](https://github.com/matt-eric/three-strike-knockout/blob/master/tailwind.config.js)

## Achieve the best experience 😀

I am suggesting using Chrome to run this app. Other browsers are having difficulty rendering the SVG sprites.

First try playing a few times using the default configuration (i.e. just click the “Start” button without adjusting anything). Get a feel for the game, and then toggle some different parameters.

*NOTE: This app was developed on a 13-inch MacBook Pro. Responsiveness attributes were programmed such that it is assumed that the app is cross-device compatible, however, it has not been tested on any other screen sizes or operating systems so there may be some responsiveness bugs on non-13-inch-Macbook-Pro devices.*

## There are three main views within the app that will ideally look like this:

### Card deck configuration modal

### Success celebration

#### *HINT: To make the game slightly more challenging, adjust the* `chipCoordinateY` *value from* `300` *to* `350`.

# 😎 🌴 Enjoy.
